\section{Introduction}

For this project, we set out to explore modeling of the semantics of a
language with mutable state using Agda as a proof checker.

We have extended a simplistic language with only boolean and number
types and no lambda abstractions or any other sort of control flow
structures.
An inductive definition of the language is provided in
\sectionref{def}.
In doing so, and proving theorems about this language, we have
encountered some challenges, which we will describe in
\sectionref{findings}.
Some possibilities we would have liked to explore, but were too
ambitious given the time frame, are described in \sectionref{further}.

\section{Findings}\label{sec:findings}

\subsection{Small step semantics}

\subsubsection{Deterministic result term}

% TODO

\subsubsection{Deterministic type of heap}

% TODO
% This proof was not really necessary, it seems...
% Look into this again

\subsubsection{Deterministic values of heap}

% TODO

\subsubsection{Uniqueness of results}

% TODO

\subsubsection{Normalization}

% TODO or omit

\subsection{Denotational semantics}

Function representation of heap is not feasible, because the
evaluation function needs to inspect it.

First attempt:

\begin{lstlisting}
     [[_]] : forall {ty f f'} -> (t : Term ty) -> St ty f f'
\end{lstlisting}

This lets you express the rule for allocation, but it is problematic
in other cases where a subexpression needs to be evaluated and
nothing is known about f'

% Second attempt:

\begin{lstlisting}
     [[_]] : forall {ty f} -> (t : Term ty) -> St ty f (extend t f)
\end{lstlisting}
where extend is an appropriate function

This lets the caller know the environment after evaluating the
subexpression, but it is not in constructor form and is therefore
hard to reason with.

\section{Hoare logic}

% TODO (Koen)

\section{Further work}\label{sec:further}

Besides having theorems about Hoare logic, the language could benefit from a `Hoare type system'. Having such a type system will enhance the ability of the programmer to specify properties about stateful programs.
% TODO refer to htt paper

The implemented language model is not sufficient for any non-trivial programming task. It lacks mechanisms for abstraction or non-trivial control flow. It could be extended with a control flow structure such as a while loop or with a fix point operator. It is desirable to preserve the strong normalization property, but this will put extra constraints on the language.
